<!--
The browser will change input boxes' <font color="#e7b416">yellow</font> to indicate that the input box had too frequent checking.
Essentially, a <font color="#e7b416">yellow</font> input box implies that the checker assumes the answer is just a guess.
<font color="#e7b416">Yellow</font> boxes do not give any indication of correctness.
After waiting / thinking a minute or so and then updating <font color="#e7b416">yellow</font> input boxes,
the checker will indicate correct answers with a <font color="green">green</font> color.
-->
A black or <font color="red">red</font> box indicates an incorrect answer.

Note that HTML select statements with drop-downs are simple multiple choice questions.
No highlighting of correct answers are done for select questions.

<font color="green">Green</font> highlight should just assist you.
If you believe your answer is correct and the input box did not turn <font color="green">green</font>,
continue on.
Per the [syllabus]({{get_url('syllabi', page_name='syllabus')}}#grading-criteria), highlighting is simply an aide not a guarantee.
