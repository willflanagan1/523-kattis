      <h2>0-1 Sequences</h2>
      <a>You are given a sequence, in the form of a string with characters ‘0’, ‘1’, and ‘?’ only. Suppose there are 𝑘 ‘?’s. Then there are 2𝑘 ways to replace each ‘?’ by a ‘0’ or a ‘1’, giving 2𝑘 different 0-1 sequences (0-1 sequences are sequences with only zeroes and ones). 
        For each 0-1 sequence, define its number of inversions as the minimum number of adjacent swaps required to sort the sequence in non-decreasing order. In this problem, the sequence is sorted in non-decreasing order precisely when all the zeroes occur before all the ones. For example, the sequence 11010 has 5 inversions. We can sort it by the following moves: 11010 → 11001 → 10101 → 01101 → 01011 → 00111.
        Find the sum of the number of inversions of the 2𝑘 sequences, modulo 1000000007 (109+7).</a>
      <h4>Input</h4>
      <a>The first and only line of input contains the input string, consisting of characters ‘0’, ‘1’, and ‘?’ only, and the input string has between 1 to 500000 characters, inclusive.</a>
      <h4>Output</h4>
      <a>Output an integer indicating the aforementioned number of inversions modulo 1000000007.</a>
